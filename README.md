This project has objective to use LLMs (such as the OpenAI GPT-3.5 API), to produce intelligence, using CVEs as our data. We got the data from the National Vulnerability Database. The aim was to create a way to interactively get more information about CVEs, such as asking questions to the agent about the respective CVE using AI. We also tried (but failed) to predict the vulnerability score of a CVE by feeding the model only a written description of it.
