This project has objective to use LLMs (such as the OpenAI GPT-3.5 API), to produce intelligence, using CVEs as our data. We got the data from the National Vulnerability Database, and we aimed to create a way to interactively get more information about CVEs, such as asking questions to the agent about the respective CVE using AI, and also a (failed) attempt to predict the vulnerability of a site or platform by feeding the model a written description of it.
