# FCUP-HACKATHON2024-v3zados

## Introduction

Welcome to the FCUP-HACKATHON2024-v3zados project repository!

This project aims to leverage Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities, particularly OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API, to enhance intelligence in handling Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).

By utilizing data from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), we've endeavored to develop interactive methods for extracting insights from CVEs:
Our primary focus has been on employing AI to answer questions and provide deeper understanding regarding specific CVEs.
The second thing was creating a dataset with ~10k entries to make a more advanced search using user input,(for example, you could the agent to show the CVEs within a daterange).
Additionally, we explored the feasibility of predicting CVE vulnerability scores solely based on textual descriptions, using a logistic regression.

## Getting Started

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by executing the following command in your terminal:

pip install -r requirements.txt

It's recommended to set up a new environment to ensure clean dependencies.
